Zinc - An unofficial fork of CSNePS to turn it into a library
======


This is an experiment to turn [CSNePS](https://github.com/SNePS/CSNePS/tree/semtype-objectlang) into a library instead of a standalone application. For starters, I removed the GUI and the -main function. A few other changes were needed, and probably a few more will be. Still, at this point all (or nearly all) of the substantial code is from the original. I'm changing the name to avoid confusion and trademark problems. I have no affiliation with any of the people and institutions involved in creating CSNePS, and no endorsement from them should be assumed. For more information on CSNePS, see the link.

I got some basic functionality working, but there's still a lot to do.
