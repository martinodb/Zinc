Zinc - An unofficial fork of CSNePS to turn it into a library
======


This is an experiment to turn [CSNePS](https://github.com/SNePS/CSNePS/tree/semtype-objectlang) into a library instead of a standalone application. For starters, I'm removing the GUI and the -main function. A few other changes are needed. Nearly all the substantial code is from the original. I'm changing the name to avoid confusion and trademark problems. I have no relation with or endorsement from CSNePS developers. For more information on CSNePS, see the link.  I got some basic functionality working, but there's still a lot to do.
