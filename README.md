CSNePS - Concurrent SNePS
======

CSNePS is an implementation (and extension of) of the <a href="http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/sneps/Projects/sneps3.html">SNePS 3</a> knowledge representation and reasoning system specification. CSNePS is written in the Clojure programming language, and is designed to utilize concurrency during inference. 

## Running CSNePS

CSNePS should be run using [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) for the best experience. Once you've installed Leiningen you can run CSnePS by changing into the CSNePS directory and typing either:

```lein run```

to launch CSNePS with its GUI, or 

```lein run -c```

to launch the command line interface for CSNePS.

## Further Documentation

While CSNePS is still under heavy development, the version available here should be usable. There is some documentation provided in the manual.pdf file in the doc folder,  but most documentation is currently in the form of papers written about SNePS 3 and portions of CSNePS. 

If you intend to use CSNePS it is best to first acquaint yourself with the SNePS 3 specification:

Next, you should aquiant yourself with Inference Graphs, which provide the natural deduction and subsumption reasoning abilities of CSNePS.
