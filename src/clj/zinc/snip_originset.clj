;;; This file includes several functions for calcluating origin sets. 
;;; Since IGs reason in all contexts simultaneously, it's often necessary to
;;; create origin sets which are the combinatoric combination of other sets,
;;; or to apply difference operations to many sets. These functions are meant
;;; to abstract that away from the implementation of IGs.
