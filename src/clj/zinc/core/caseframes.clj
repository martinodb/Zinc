;Molecular Terms, Caseframes, Caseframe Print-Patterns, Parsing, and
;Generating.
;
;The user types and sees a molecular term in KIF format: (f a1 ... an).
;The issues are:
;    finding the caseframe to use to represent the term (parsing);
;    reconstructing the expression from the stored term (generating).
;
;Generation is easy.
;    The stored term is essentially represented as an instance,:
;        (slot1 filler1 ... slotn fillern)
;    of a caseframe that has a sequence of slots (slot1 ... slotn)
;    and a print-pattern, a list of pattern elements: (pe1 ... pen),
;        where each pei is a slot name, or a quoted symbol.
;    The generated expression is (pe1' ... pen'),
;        where pei' is pei itself if pei is quoted,
;                   and is the generated term(s) which fill the pei
;                   slot otherwise.
;
;Parsing is more difficult.
;It requires retrieving the caseframe from the function symbol, f.
;There are 3 cases:
;1)  The function symbol doesn't occur in the represented term, but is represented by the caseframe.
;    An example is Isa, represented by the (member class) caseframe.
;    In this case the function symbol is mapped to the caseframe in FN2CF,
;                 and appears quoted in the print-pattern.
;
;2) The function symbol occurs in the represented term,
;       because it is one of several instances
;       of a more general function, which is represented by the case frame.
;   Examples are (senseFor smell) and (go left),
;       which might both be represented by the (action object) caseframe.
;   In this case, the print-pattern will have all non-quoted pe's.
;                 and every function symbol that uses this caseframe
;                     needs to be mapped to the caseframe in FN2CF.
;
;3) The function symbol is a molecular term.
;   For example, for any binary relation R,
;       e(R) could be the reflexive closure of R
;       defined by the axiom
;           (forall R (=> (binaryRelation R) (forall (x y) (iff ((e R) x y) (or (R x y) (= x y))))))
;   Generation is easily done:
;       I'll assume that pe1 of the print pattern will be an unquoted slot name,
;       and the function-symbol slot will be filled by a molecular term
;   but for parsing, we need a mapping from e to the caseframe that
;   will be used for representing (e R),
;   and then a mapping from that term to the caseframe that will be
;   used for the representation of ((e R) a b).
;   We can do that by having a caseframe as the key in the mapping FN2CF.
;   Map e to the caseframe for (e R),
;       and that caseframe to the caseframe for ((e R) a b), etc.
;   In general the function symbol slot could be filled by a molecular term,
;      whose function symbol slot is filled by a molecular term, etc.
;      E.g. (((e1 R) a b) c d), and so on.
;      Map e1 to its caseframe, that caseframe to the next, etc.
;   The problems are now:
;      How does the user tell SNePS what that sequence is?
;      How does the user specify which slot gets the function "symbol"?
;   Idea:  The user should use defineCaseframe as for when pe1 is a slot name
;          and the fsymbols argument should include the primitive function symbol
;               enclosed in the appropriate number of lists.
;          So for (senseFor smell) and (go left)
;	   the fsymbols are senseFor and go
;             for ((e R) a b) the fsymbol is (e)
;             for (((e1 R) a b) c d) the fsymbol is ((e1))
